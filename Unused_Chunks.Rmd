```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Since we will probably be doing a significant about of looping in the future,
I'll include an aside here for how to convert a for loop to an lapply with 0 pain.


```{r}

# as an aside, we could do this iteratively in a for-loop, but it is almost always
# bad practice to do so. Here, we'll just take a quick look at how to convert a 
# for-loop to an lapply painlessly.

# as a for-loop
forDF <- data.frame()
for(k in 1:10){
    forDF <- rbind(forDF, S[k,])
}

# as an lapply
lappDF <- lapply(1:10, function(k){
    S[k,]
}) %>% bind_rows(.)

identical(lappDF, forDF)

```
